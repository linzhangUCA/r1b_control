# r1b_control
R1Bot's code base.
All the scripts are tested on a [Pico-series microcontroller](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html) using [MicroPython](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/rp2/quickref.html).

## Usage

### 1. Differential Drive Base Control
Upload all scripts in [differential_drive](differential_drive/) directory to the pico board.


### 2. Ultrasonic Distance Sensing
Upload [distance_sensor.py](ultrasonic_sense/distance_sensor.py) to the Pico board.
